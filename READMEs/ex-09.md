# ex-09-decoder-interactive

## Overview

Decoder interactive requires implementation of the UI, which includes several web elements with ids and forms. The tests and selenium pick up the web elements using ids, and then performs actions on them. In this specific exercise the functionality of persistence is tested, which requires the use of local storage.

## Tests

**`1. Driver exists and Loads`** : Checks if the driver is initialized correctly, and if the page loads. CRITICAL test.

*`2. Not Empty Title`* : Checks if the title is not empty.

*`3. Elements are present`* : Checks if the elements are in the page and accessible.

*`4. Clear Button added`* : Checks if the clear button was added

*`5. Persistence Part 1 : Encode & Decode works correctly`* : Checks if the encoding and decoding works normally.

*`6. Persistence Part 2 : Persistence works correctly, and clear has no errors`* : Checks if the state remains the same after a soft-refresh.

*`7. Persistence Part 3 : Clear resets the storage`* : Checks if the clear button resets the storage as intended.

## Element Map

Below is how selenium maps the elements in the web page. This is used to perform actions on the elements. They can be edited according to how the user defined their elements.
```js
const elementMap = {
    key : {
        type: 'id',
        locator: 'key'
    },
    encode : { 
        type: 'id',
        locator: 'encode'
    },
    encoded : {
        type: 'id',
        locator: 'encoded'
    },
    decode : {
        type: 'id',
        locator: 'decode'
    },
    decoded : {
        type: 'id',
        locator: 'decoded'
    },
    clear : {
        type: 'id',
        locator: 'clear-state'
    }
}
```
For reference on how elements are accessed : 
```js
// Assuming the element we want is 'key'
const key = await driver.findElement(By[elementMap['key'].type](elementMap['key'].locator))
```
