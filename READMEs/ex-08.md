# ex-08-chessboard

## Overview

Checkerboard is based on the UI. It consists of a grid- a div, where elements (squares) are added into it. Grid doesn't need to have an id - the element can be picked up using the xpath.

## Element Map

Below is how selenium maps the elements in the web page. This is used to perform actions on the elements. They can be edited according to how the user defined their elements.
```js
const elementMap = {
    grid : {
        type : "id",
        locator : "theGrid"
    }
}
```
For reference on how elements are accessed : 
```js
// Assuming the element we want is 'key'
const key = await driver.findElement(By[elementMap['key'].type](elementMap['key'].locator))
```
